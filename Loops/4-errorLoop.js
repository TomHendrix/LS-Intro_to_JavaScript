// Doe the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ) {
    console.log(i += 1);
}

// The code doesnt produce an error since all 3 components of the for loop are optional. In this code, we omit the "next value" component; however, this isnt a problem
// here since we increment the loop variable on line 2.
// The code outputs the following:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
